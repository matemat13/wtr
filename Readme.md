# Walker Timer Reminder

A simple python3 script, which reminds you to take a walk after a certain time with a small popup window.
The period at which the popup is displayed may be set using the `--period` command line parameter.
The walk duration may be set using the `--duration` command line parameter.
That's basically all there is to it.
